## Background and Overview 
Relatable is a SQL visualization playground to help users understand referencing and SQL joins.

## Functionality and MVPs 
Using RelaTable, users will be able to:

* click the "Connect" button or drag and drop to create reference columns
* click through the four different JOIN button/filters to see what the result of different joins would be
* view the JOIN output in the bottom pane
* click on a reference column to expand and display the connected records

Bonus:
* display many to many relationships on a 'many-to-many' tab which includes a third castings table
