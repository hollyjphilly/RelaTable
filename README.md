## Relatable
A SQL visualizer to help users understand referencing, one-to-many relationships, and SQL joins.

## Functionality and MVPs 
Using RelaTable, users will be able to:
* click the "Connect" button to create reference columns
* click through the four different JOIN button/filters to see what the result of different joins would be
* view the JOIN output in the bottom pane

Future Bonus Features:
* display many to many relationships on a 'many-to-many' tab which includes a third "castings" table
* tables are editable (possible refactor to canvas data grid)

## Technologies & Challenges
With this project, I challenged myself to implement an interactive and animated JS project while forgoing the useful tools React and Canvas. I wanted to make something simple and useful, so I dreamed up Relatable, a visual tool that I wished I had access to when I first started learning about relational databases.

I love to create useful things, so I dreamed up a lot of functionality for Relatable at the start. In addition to the base MVPs, I wanted to create robust animations, teach both one-to-many and many-to-many relationships, and make the database tables editable. While these are great features that I do plan to implement in the future, I decided to limit myself to the core functionality I knew I could complete within my four day timeline.

## Implementation Timeline 
* Day 1 - basic page with button,table elements, and instructions
* Day 2 - add functionality to buttons (creates reference columns, creates JOIN code and output)
* Day 3 - add styling and animation to buttons and output
* Day 4 - additional styling, wrap up, and error fixing
