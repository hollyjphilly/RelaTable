With this project, I challenged myself to implement an interactive and animated JS project while forgoing the useful tools React and Canvas. I wanted to make something simple yet useful, so a visual tool like RelaTable seemed like a good idea. RelaTable is the tool I wish I had when first learning about relational databases, and I hope others benefit from it too.

I love to create useful things, so I dreamed up a lot of functionality for Relatable at the start. In addition to the base MVP, I wanted to create robust animations, teach both one-to-many and many-to-many relationships, and make the database tables editable. While these are great features that I still plan to implement in the future, I decided to limit myself to the core functionality I knew I could complete within my four day timeline.

Using RelaTable, users are able to:
* Create references between tables
* Generate SQL code, useful visuals, and animated SQL output data through the click of a button
* Hover over JOIN buttons to learn about specific JOINs
* Access additional resources about one-to-many and many-to-many relationships

Upcoming Features:
* includes a third "castings" join table and output to demo many-to-many relationships
* furthur interaction and animation to show connections between records (highlighting or lines drawn to show connected rows)
* users can edit the tables (possible refactor to canvas data grid)
